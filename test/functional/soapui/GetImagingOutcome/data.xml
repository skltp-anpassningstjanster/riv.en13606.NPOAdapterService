    <testcase id="Basic Testcase">
        <description>Verifies that the response is schema- and schematron- valid and contains data for the requested patient only.<br/>
            The only requirement on test data is that there is some data for the given patientId.
            It might be a good idea to start by executing this testcase for a patient with a very simple response and when that works switch to a patient with more complex data.
